### Setup

### Directions
Solve at least 3 of the challenges below. Create a file using the language for your program (`challenge1.rb` or `challenge1.js`) for each of the challenges you select. For each challenge you complete, include comments showing the **overall goal** in your own words, your **pseudocode**, and your **final solution**. 

1. Given an array of strings, return only the strings that have exactly 4 characters.
2. Start with an array of strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Print every word in all lowercase letters.
3. Given an array of strings, return only the words that begin with the letter "t".
4. Start with an array of strings. Print only the words that include the letter combination "ing".
5. Start with an array of travel destinations. Print every travel destination in alphabetical order embedded in a sentence using string interpolation. For example, if the destination is "New York City", print something like "The next place I want to visit is New York City!" 
6. Given a sentence with only lowercase letters, print the same sentence with the first letter of every word capitalized. For example, if you were given "Turing is the best", return "Turing Is The Best" instead!
